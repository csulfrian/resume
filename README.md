## Professional Experience

### Python/Django Developer - Vapor Propulsion Labs (VPL), _November 2022 - Present_

- Designed, implemented, and launched two cloud-based Bill of Materials Generators - one for Bosch eBike Systems and 
one for 3X3 hubs (Django, Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Django AllAuth)
- Wrote, trained, and deployed a SKU-level inventory forecasting system to reduce inventory cash burden and mitigate the 
risks of stock-out situations using data from multiple sources (SKLearn, QuickBooks SDK, Shopify SDK, Smartsheet API, 
Google Compute Engine, OAuth2, Python, Django)
- Wrote tools used company-wide for customer and inventory management across different platforms (Django, Python, 
QuickBooks SDK, Shopify SDK, Smartsheet API, Google Compute Engine, Docker)

### Data Scientist - Plutoshift Inc, _April 2021 - September 2022_

- Wrote, trained, and validated production machine learning models for reverse osmosis water filtration, wastewater 
chemical dosing, and anomaly detection applications (Python, SKLearn, Facebook Prophet, Google Cloud Platform)
- Developed an algorithm to optimize the usage of a chemical added to municipal sewage for odor and corrosion control; 
achieved a reduction of nearly 80% at the pilot site within three months (Customer Requirements, Cross-Functional 
Communication)
- Managed product requirements, roadmap, and priorities in close collaboration with customers (Requirements 
Engineering, Product Management, Kanban)

### Data Scientist (contract) - Riley Gold, _September 2020 - May 2021_
- Wrote a data processing pipeline to take raw geochemical assay data and transform it into a format that their GIS 
software could ingest; this process was something that was previously done manually (Business Requirements, Customer 
Communication, Python)  
- Analyzed geochemical assay data to identify elements commonly associated with gold in rock formations, then built a 
ML model to predict gold concentrations based on those findings; the company then implemented a targeted assaying 
program based on the model's predictions, leading to a reduction in lab costs while enhancing confidence in marginal
gold concentrations in the field (Customer Requirements, SKLearn, Python)

### Data Engineer (contract) - Gates Corporation, _January 2021 - April 2021_
- Scripted an ETL pipeline to build a MySQL database that hydrated a customer-facing website, allowing a guided 
selection of valid component combinations; this removed a major pain point for OEM customers and streamlined 
their ordering process (Python, MySQL)

## Education

### Data Science Immersive Bootcamp - Galvanize Inc, _June 2020 - September 2020_
- A 13-week data science immersive comprising 700+ hours of coding, weekly case studies, and 3 capstone projects. 
Python-based curriculum focused on machine learning and best practices in data science and statistical analysis.

### Bachelor's Degree - Colorado State University, _August 2000 - December 2004_
- Fine Arts, Metalsmithing and Jewlery
